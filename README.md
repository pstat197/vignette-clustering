Abstract: Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning model that involves grouping observations using various algorithms. This vignette covers 2 clustering methods: Hierarchical and K-means clustering. Using the UCI, quality of white wine dataset, both Hierarchical and K-means clustering are performed RESULTS HERE [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

Repository:
- vignette-clustering.qmd is the primary file that reviews the discussed clustering methods.
-   Data - This folder contains the raw and clean wine quality data.
-   Scripts - Scratchwork and practice code that was used to put together the final qmd file.
