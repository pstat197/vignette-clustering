# K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning method in machine learning (there is no response variable to evaluate the model off of). This method is used to group data points into K clusters where K is a tuning parameter chosen by the user. After initially randomly assigning data points to a cluster, the model iterates until the clusters are settled into their respective groups. The clustering is determined by the distance from the center of each cluster. The function used for k-means clustering is `kmeans()` found in the stats package.

```{r}
